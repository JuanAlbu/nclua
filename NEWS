NCLua NEWS -- History of user-visible changes.                 -*-outline-*-

* Version 1.2, August 20, 2014, Guilherme F. Lima

  - Fix the order of parameters for NCL class filters in event.register.

    The ITU-T H761 standard enforces the following possible orders for NCL
    filter parameters in event.register calls:

    (1) event.register (f, 'ncl', 'presentation', LABEL, ACTION);
    (2) event.register (f, 'ncl', 'selection',    LABEL, ACTION);
    (3) event.register (f, 'ncl', 'attribution',  NAME, VALUE).

    In previous versions of NCLua, however, event.register expected ACTION
    to come before LABEL.  This has been fixed.  Now event.register expects
    LABEL followed by ACTION, as shown in cases (1) and (2) above.

* Version 1.1, July 11, 2014, Guilherme F. Lima

  - Call g_type_init in systems where it must be explicitly called.

  - Make build system compatible with MinGW.

  - Add contrib/debian subdir with debian packaging stuff.

  - Add new examples: luarocks and pacman.

  - Improve the compatibility of tests.

* Version 1.0, April 9, 2014, Guilherme F. Lima

  - First release.
