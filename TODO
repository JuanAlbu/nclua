NCLua TODO -- Tasks that need implementing.                    -*-outline-*-

* KNOWN BUGS

  + nclua/event/socket.c: Pending operations on disconnect_finished()

    The disconnect_finished() function should cancel pending send or receive
    operations.  Otherwise, the 'disconnect' event will cause these
    operations to fail with 'Socket closed' error.  Currently, to avoid
    reporting such errors, we check if the socket is connected before
    dispatching errors.

* FEATURES OR PROBLEMS

  + Generate API documentation

  + lib/ncluaw.c: Check event syntax in ncluaw_send()

    The ncluaw_send() function should check the syntax its event parameter.

  + nclua/canvas.c: Add canvas:_resize (new_w, new_h)

    Currently, it is not possible to resize the surface of a canvas.  In
    fact, you can allocate another canvas and then compose the original one
    scaled onto the new canvas, but this is not a "true" resize operation.

  + src/nclua.c: Add options to the nclua standalone player

    Some useful options:
      --version     print version information
      --help        print help information
      --debug       print debugging information
      --load=FILE   load FILE before running the given script
      --plugin=FILE load and registers FILE as a new event plugin

    If no input file is given, nclua should read input from stdin.

  + src/nclua.c: Add widgets to the player window

    It would be useful to have a menu bar and status bar.  The latter, for
    example, could show the current frame-rate.

  + src/nclua.c: Add support to configuration options

    These could be given via command-line options, environment variables, or
    a configuration file (e.g., ~/.nclua).

  + List the problems with the ABNT standard

    E.g., the standard establishes that the size canvas:attrFont() is given
    in pixels.  This is probably wrong; most APIs support only point values.
    We're thus assuming that font size is given in points.

* OPTIMIZATION AND CLEAN UP

  + src/nclua.c: Improve GTK+ to NCLua key event mapping

  + build-aux/syntax-check-copyright: Make it project independent

    This way we can use it in other projects (cf. syntax-check).

  + configure.ac: Move coverage checks to separated file

    E.g., configure.ac.coverage.
